Welcome to the **Jommo workflow**!

Criteria of Jommo :

- DRY : don't repeat yourselve
- Progressive : accessible to anyone, with bare minimum knowdlege in JS

Purposes of Jommo :

- make development of libraries accessible
- be up to date to best practices

Advantages of Jommo compared to other workflows :
